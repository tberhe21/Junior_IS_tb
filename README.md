# Image Processing and Classification of Over-the-Counter Drugs Using Convolutional Neural Network

My Junior independent study focuses on image recognition, processing, 
and classification of over the counter and prescription medication using deep learning.
This project is a web app that lets users select an image then it 
outputs the class of the images. 
Even though the intention was to compare it to another model that uses text to train a model
that part of the code does not work as a consequence of limited resource.

## Installation
Install specific packages using !pip <package> for most of the codes it is already there

## Usage instruction 
The py files are able to run and there will be an output in the terminal. As for the ipnyb files 
run every chuck one after the other.
